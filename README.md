# aliste-smarthome
smarthome repository for aliste

You can see two folders here , one is the basic template that should will be used in lambda for alexa , another one is the authorization server code for oauth through.

What we need to do is send a post request from the lambda of the alexa skill to our oauth server to change the state of the switch , light or whatever the stuff we want. Some routes are already created , just send the post requests then your work is done.

you will need the credential of my alexA SKILL ACC AND LAMDa acc I guess.
